###ArcGIS API

My map shows the locations of some of my favorite vacation spots and some places I would like to visit in the future.

I changed the symbology of the points as well as the basemap. In the popups I altered them by adding content. I included a function that zooms to the point that you click on. I created a clustering effect to group points. I added a search bar that allows users to search for a city.
